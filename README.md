A previous version used Matt Gemmell's MAAttachedWindow for notifications, instead of Mountain Lion's Notification Center.

Requirements
------------
- OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion (it uses Notification Center)

It's easy to make it (dynamically) fall back to MAAttachedWindow for previous versions of OS X. But I'm unlikely to do it myself, since I don't have access to an older OS X version right now, and trying to build something blindly isn't efficient. If you can do it, that'd be great. Please submit a pull request and I'll merge it.
